<section class="level1" data-number="1" id="the-life-of">
<h1 data-number="1"><span class="header-section-number">1</span> The Life Of</h1>
<p>Hello! This is my first blog post. My intent is to have a space to share some of my thoughts in a more informal way. Today I’ll introduce myself in an overly dramatic way.</p>
<section class="level2" data-number="1.1" id="early-life">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="early-life" data-number="1.1"><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Early Life</h2>
<p>Ok, maybe too dramatic.</p>
<p>I’ve always lived in São Paulo, which has its flaws, but it is a very diverse city. I especially love carnaval, the Virada Cultural, and its street bars. I also like getting around with public transport, though again, it has its flaws.</p>
<p>Anyway, school days were nice, with lots of friends I carry to this day, and lots of very bad football. While I was not particularly studious, I liked helping colleagues and decided that I wanted to be a teacher at some point.</p>
<p>Until 2021, I was part of the scout movement, which is awesome. I learned lots of important values and skills, and did some meaningful community projects. Because of it, now I am the friend who is very <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@.aidanbaker/video/7570150449853091085">invested in keeping the fire going</a>. There, I also made friends for life.</p>
<p>Below, one of the best moments as a scout: going up Mount Fuji in the 2015 World Jamboree. We started the climb very late to see the sunrise from the top. I immediately fell asleep when I got to the summit, didn’t see the sunrise, but it was a damn good nap—no regrets.</p>

<section class="level2" data-number="1.2" id="graduation">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="graduation" data-number="1.2"><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Graduation</h2>
<p>I liked many subjects in high school; I just wanted to be a teacher in any of them. I ended up starting my undergrad in Economics at FGV-EESP in 2019. I learned to love the formality and rigor of economics and academic knowledge as a whole. I started enjoying studying more (pfft, nerd 🤭).</p>
<p>In 2020, the COVID pandemic hit. But on a good note, I joined GVCode, the data science and programming student league at FGV. I learned Python in its trainee program, and after a year I became HR director, responsible for the selection process and the trainee program. The selection process was a blast; we did a very challenging but relaxed process, and organizing the Python trainee program for eventually two years was great. I realized my preferred way of learning is teaching others. One semester after becoming HR director, I became vice-president, which taught me and my president partner so much, especially through our mistakes. Overall, the league, while with its flaws, had some high-quality learning experiences, while at the same time being very relaxed and not taking itself too seriously. I keep it in my heart.</p>

<p>Also around 2020, I started learning R, and soon began answering questions on Stack Overflow. All the courses were very applied, and I wanted to dig deeper into how things worked. I started reading some books, curating, translating, and turned that material into my own book: <a href="https://ricardo-semiao.github.io/library/rfcd/">R: Fundamentos e Ciência de Dados</a>. It is still under construction, but I am very proud of it. It is authorial, but inspired by existing literature. It is available in the navbar above. This material was used in teaching assistantships and as a semester-long course for GVCode members.</p>
<p>Further in my graduation, I was also a teaching assistant for Econometrics, and a research assistant for Professor Jéferson Colombo, building an <a href="https://github.com/mevaldt/diversified_crypto">R Shiny app</a> for crypto portfolio optimization and analysis, with Ripple funding.</p>
<p>After the pandemic ended, I got to enjoy a little more of university life. Don’t tell my FGV compatriots, but I went to the best university games, BIFE from USP, disguised as a philosophy student, and had a blast.</p>
<p>I found out about many more applied paths outside of academia and teaching, but these kept being points of interest for me. For all of them, I wanted to keep studying and prepared for the ANPEC test, the Brazil-wide exam for economics graduate programs. I had lots of family support and time to study, and wound up with 10th place in the country, next to some colleagues. I was invited to visit the FGV-Rio and PUC-Rio universities in Rio de Janeiro, which was very fun, but eventually decided to stay in EESP for its strong Econometrics program.</p>

<section class="level2" data-number="1.3" id="masters">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="masters" data-number="1.3"><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Master’s</h2>
<p>Before my master’s started, I got to learn lots of theoretical Computer Science and started developing my code packages (in the navbar above). I got tired of the intense statistics programming and learned the cuter web dev to create the first draft of this site. On a side note, open source is an important value and stepping stone for the world (what do you mean people do things without a profit incentive?), donate to your favorite projects if you can!</p>
<p>The master’s has been very challenging, but very nice. It is very satisfying learning the very formal knowledge behind Economic Theory, and also the more advanced applied practices. I did several computational-related courses, and also some Bayesian Statistics—very nice. I am doing my thesis with Prof. Marcelo Fernandes, looking to understand the performance of regime-switching models in the presence of mis-specification, and how it relates to regime-conditional characteristics of the dependent variable.</p>

<section class="level2" data-number="1.4" id="next-steps">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="next-steps" data-number="1.4"><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Next Steps</h2>
<p>For now, finishing the thesis. No spoilers.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" data-number="1.5" id="controversies">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="controversies" data-number="1.5"><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Controversies</h2>
<p>Just kidding 😅.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="level1" data-number="2" id="interests">
<h1 data-number="2"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Interests</h1>
<section class="level2" data-number="2.1" id="film-tv-and-books">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="film-tv-and-books" data-number="2.1"><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Film, TV, and Books</h2>
<p>I am horrible at consistently consuming films/tv/books, people judge me. I don’t really know what my favorite movies are, but I cry in a bunch of them. One of the most recent perpetrators was Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. For books, I should read more, but some childhood ones are the Narnia Chronicles and The Little Prince.</p>
<p>For TV series, I can be a little more opinionated. My favorite is Dark, followed by Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Maid and Bodies were also awesome.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" data-number="2.2" id="games">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="games" data-number="2.2"><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Games</h2>
<p>I always loved video games. Outside of Sly Cooper 3 and PES 2008, mostly on PC. I really like story-rich single player games. Some of my favorites are Diablo II, Half Life 1 (no, I haven’t played the 2 yet, maybe when the 3 comes out…), and Subnautica. I also like simulation games, like Civilization IV and Cities Skylines. And finally, Minecraft and League of Legends are also played from time to time. As a child, I loved Legos.</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" data-number="2.3" id="others">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="others" data-number="2.3"><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Others</h2>
<p>I wouldn’t call it a hobby, nor that I am specially good at it, but I like cooking and taking photos. The cooking is more ‘scout food’, improvisational food, but spicy tho. Some of the photos can be seen in the gallery (at the navbar above).</p>
</section>
<section class="level2" data-number="2.4" id="music">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="music" data-number="2.4"><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> Music</h2>
<p>During my childhood, I had a music player with: The Offspring (Smash to Days Go By), Audioslave (all 3), and Coldplay (A Rush of Blood to the Head and Parachutes). For some time I did pilates class, and my teacher listened to punk rock during it—it was awesome. I’ll try to show some non-obvious picks that stuck with me.</p>
<p>From Audioslave, #1 Zero was the first song alphabetically in my playlists, so I listened to it a lot, and it rules:</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0wxR6vA8Je5JHiTsZSmG01?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>I really think that Coldplay’s first albums are looked down on by the rock dudes, but they are great. “Yes” is a song in a deeper voice, and with different instrumentals:</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/04zfFfRMXegKi4mMkGMeze?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>The Offspring I don’t hear that much nowadays, but here is a solid one:</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0GlTcDHNVSbx1Oy8kQqRMB?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>Later there was Linkin Park, Muse, Queens of the Stone Age, and Gorillaz.</p>
<p>For Linkin Park, “Overflow” is my favorite from the new album, and I saw it live in São Paulo 8/11/2025:</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2Yh356WJoVcWleiWRFoLUa?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>From Muse, it’s really hard. I’m gonna go with “Recess” from the very weird Hullabaloo Soundtrack—it makes me scream. I love so many others though; “Hyper Music” for a long time was the perfect rock song for me.</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4fv1bVofsMcwqGZpMT6eSv?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>From QotSA, I love “The Vampire of Time and Memory” and “I Sat By the Ocean.” To be a little less obvious:</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/7mGAH8wfCljwG0tBi9WMGJ?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>From Gorillaz, there are some: “Fire Coming out of the Monkey’s Head,” “Let Me Out,” but I’m going with:</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4M88Wd7Aps5LGRWMOC7gSH?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>Today I am hearing a lot of Nine Inch Nails. My favorite so far is “We’re in This Together,” but stay with:</p>
<iframe allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="embed-iframe" frameborder="0" height="352" loading="lazy" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4bTYuyH7wejFS2e82i6pPb?utm_source=generator" style="border-radius:12px" width="100%"></iframe>
<p>Nowadays I am pretty eclectic, and I think we should strive for that in many places in life. Still, I haven’t taken the time to properly expand my playlist. To close up, here are some lesser known artists/songs I like:</p>
