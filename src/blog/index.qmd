Welcome to my blog! I post mostly about something that I made and how, or about something that I learned and didn't found an educational resource quite how I like.

The posts are filterable by clicking on the categories, or with the filter bar, which also supports dates. This blog is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), plus the custom build process of the site as a whole.
