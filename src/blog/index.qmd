Welcome to my blog! I mostly post about things I have made and how I made them, or about something I learned when I could not find an educational resource that suited me.

You can filter posts by clicking on the categories or using the filter bar, which also supports dates. This blog is built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org), along with a custom build process for the site as a whole.
